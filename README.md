## A few things to note
For the time being, you'll need Rust's package manager - cargo - installed in order to install this properly

I am planning to develop this as an extension for Python using [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3).

This library is very much in its early stages of development. There are only a few functions that have been written as of yet.

## Getting Started
### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joerex1418/mlbapi.git
```
### 2. Change Directory
```bash
cd mlbapi
```
### 3. Install the binary
```bash
cargo install --path .
```
